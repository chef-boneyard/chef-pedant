# Taken from the Ruby 1.9.3 standard library
# Connecting via SSL requires a Host header. It does not
# quote ipv6 literals. Although there are no official RFC for HTTP
# explicitly allowing [] to quote ipv6 literals, it seems sensible and
# some folks are implementing it.
#
# Unfortunately, the Ruby standard library does not make this easy to
# monkey patch. We actually have to monkey patch the entire connect() method,
# making this brittle. It is included here because Pedant runs against HTTPS.
# Chef client uses it's own custom connection code. The other Ruby server bits
# do not use https to connect internally, and many of them will be taken out
# when they are fully ported to Erlang. We also control the Omnibus build
# process and the specific version of Ruby to use. This is considered acceptable
# until a longer-term solution (such as submitting a patch upstream) is
# implemented.
